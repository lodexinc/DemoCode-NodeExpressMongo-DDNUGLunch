# Demo Code from DDNUG Lunch Meeting

It was great to present to the inaugural Meeting of the Dallas .Net User Group Downtown Lunch Meeting.  This code was what we created across the hour.

To get it running, please do the following:

``` bash
npm install
node index.js
```

The PDF in this directory has the (limited) slides from the presentation.
